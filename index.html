		<p>I am Senior Lecturer in the Department of Psychological Science at the University of Vermont. I teach courses on Introductory Psychology, Developmental Psychology, and Statistics. My research focuses on how children and adults learn and process logical language. 

			<p> I completed my PhD at Stanford University in 2016, where I worked with <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/" target="_blank">Michael Frank</a> in the Language and Cognition Lab studying how children learn and understand logical words in communicative contexts. Before that, I was an undergraduate at Smith College where I worked with <a href="https://www.smith.edu/academics/faculty/jill-de-villiers" target="_blank">Jill de Villiers</a> studying the relationship between linguistic and conceptual development.  From 2016 - 2023 I was an Assistant/Associate Professor in the campus Psychology Department at Southern New Hampshire University. </p>
