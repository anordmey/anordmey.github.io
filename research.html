		<h3>Development of language & logic</h3>

		<p>The study of logical connectives &mdash; words like "not" and "or" &mdash; presents a puzzle: We use these words all the time, and yet both adults and children can struggle to understand these words in experimental tests. One solution to this puzzle is <em>context</em>. In the real world, we almost never hear any sentence without a rich linguistic, communicative, and sensory context. If I said to you, “There are <b>no</b> giraffes in this house,” you would probably be confused; you might even think that what I had said was wrong, even though it is (probably) true. If we were at the zoo, however, and we had just entered the Giraffe House, suddenly the same sentence is perfectly reasonable. We cannot divorce logic from context if we want to understand how we process logical sentences in the real world. My work explores how children's and adults' understanding of logical words, like negation, is influenced by different communicative contexts. </p>
